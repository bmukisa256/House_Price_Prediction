House Price Prediction 🏠📈

This project uses machine learning — specifically Linear regression as well implementing also steps for Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression — to predict house prices based on various features like bedrooms, floors, waterfront and more. It includes data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

Included
- House_Price_Prediction_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full workflow.
- House price prediction.csv: Raw dataset used for training/testing.

Techniques Used
- Data cleaning & feature dropping
- Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)
- Hyperparameter tuning using LassoCV
- Model evaluation (Mean_Absolute_Error)

How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab.
2. Install required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
3. Run all cells sequentially.
